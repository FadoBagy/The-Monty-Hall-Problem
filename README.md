## About
This is a website dedicated to **The Monty Hall Problem**. Its purpose is to help you understand the problem and try out the game 🙂

## Game
You can start playing the game by pressing the `Start` button. You then have to choose which door to open. After that, a red (*non-reward door*) will close. Then you will have the option to **stay** with your initial door or to **change** with the other. The goal is to find the green (*reward*) door. At any time you can click the `Reset` button, which restarts the game. All controls are done with the mouse.

## Statistics
After each game the results are recorded in the **Stats** section. There are several pieces of information recorded:

- **Total Games** - the number of games played
- **Overall Wins** - how many game are won
- **Overall Loses** - how many game are lost
- **Wins With Switch** - games won by changing your initial door 
- **Loses With Switch** - games lost by changing your initial door
- **Switch Win Rate** - the percentage of games won by changing doors
- **Stay Win Rate** - the percentage of games won by *not* changing doors

At any time you can click the `Reset` button, which resets the statistics.

## Info
The section **Info** contains information about the origin of the game and briefly explains the *problem*. There is also a link to the Wikipedia page.

## Monty Mayhem
Monty Mayhem is an exaggerated version of the game. Originally there are only **three** doors to choose from, but in this game mode you can choose between **10 to 50** doors. Enter the amount of door you want to play with and click `Submit`, then you will be redirected to the game mode page. The controls are the same as the original game and at any time you can click the `Back` button to return to the main page.
